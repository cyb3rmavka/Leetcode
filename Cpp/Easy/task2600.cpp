/*There is a bag that consists of items, each item has a number 1, 0, or -1 written on it.

You are given four non-negative integers numOnes, numZeros, numNegOnes, and k.

The bag initially contains:

numOnes items with 1s written on them.
numZeroes items with 0s written on them.
numNegOnes items with -1s written on them.
We want to pick exactly k items among the available items. Return the maximum possible sum of numbers written on the items.*/
